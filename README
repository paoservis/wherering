This is WhereRing.

Prerequisites:
  Ant-Contrib 1.3b http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
  AspectJ 1.6.8    http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
earlier versions might work.

AspectJ dependencies are included with distributions of this program, but we assume that you've already installed ant-contrib.

Actually, you may be able to get away without ant-contrib for debug builds. We started using it just for version numbering, which doesn't matter for debugging.

To build with ant:
$ ant debug
or
$ ant release

To build with Eclipse:
$ ant configure
or
$ ant -Dconfig-suffix=release -Dif-release-t-nil=t configure
and then use Eclipse in the usual way.

If you have trouble with ant:
---
build.xml:49: taskdef class com.android.ant.SetupTask cannot be found
---
the problem is that ant needs a hint about where to find your Android SDK:
$ cp local.properties.tmpl local.properties
$ emacs local.properties
(customize to taste)

AndroidManifest.xml is prepared by ant from the AndroidManifest.xml.tmpl file. This allows us to enable/disable debugging and do other routine customizations without polluting source control history or inconveniencing programmers too much.
